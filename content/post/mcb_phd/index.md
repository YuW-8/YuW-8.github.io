[Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology](https://mcb.illinois.edu/departments/molecular-integrative-physiology) aim to understand gene products across various levels of biological organization, ranging from molecules and macromolecular complexes to cells, tissues, and entire organisms. Utilizing molecular genetics, biophysics, and contemporary systems biology, physiologists are leading the way in life and biomedical sciences.

**I’m thrilled to start my PhD journey this fall 2020 in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign!**
