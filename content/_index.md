        As a dedicated cancer researcher, my long-term aspiration is to lead the development of innovative, effective treatments that minimize side effects and address the diverse needs of patients. 
        
        Throughout my academic journey, I have observed a significant disconnect between the abundance of research findings and their limited translation into meaningful clinical outcomes. I believe this critical gap can be bridged through impactful translational cancer research. 
        
        With my proficiency in both wet and dry lab methodologies, I am poised to drive the transformation of scientific breakthroughs into practical applications that enhance patient care and improve lives.

        Cholesterol metabolites play crucial roles in the progression of breast cancer. Our previous research has shown that myeloid immune cells, a dominant cell type within the tumor microenvironment, are especially sensitive to variations in cholesterol regulation.

        Oxysterols, which are oxidized forms of cholesterol, serve as ligands for nuclear receptors. Growing evidence underscores the importance of nuclear receptors, particularly those involved in cholesterol metabolism, in influencing cancer progression through their roles in tumor immunology.

        My research focuses on elucidating the functions of the nuclear receptor LRH-1/NR5A2, a vital regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, within myeloid immune cells and exploring its subsequent effects on breast cancer progression.
